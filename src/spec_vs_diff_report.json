      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Restore the application code to match Version 27 exactly (backend + frontend), including Guest/Hotel/Admin pages/panels and dependent backend APIs.",
      "reason": "The diff shows no substantive restoration/reversion of backend/main.mo or the actual frontend route/page/component source files—only a build version string update and summary/metadata files. A truncated summary file mentions many restored routes/pages, but the diff does not include those file content changes.",
