  "summary": "Implements the requested admin-only deployment/build verification panel, updates BUILD_VERSION, and extends the deploy/publish guidance with English-only cache-busting instructions and a reload button. One minor spec gap: the admin panel does not appear to surface a distinct “canister host” identifier beyond hostname/network detection.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Display detected network/canister host information if available (in addition to basic runtime info).",
      "reason": "The new admin panel shows Hostname and a coarse Network label (IC vs Local), but there is no clear canister host/id detection or display beyond window.location.hostname.",
