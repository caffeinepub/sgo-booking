  "summary": "Implemented the frontend build version bump to v33 and added an admin-facing Caffeine deploy UI notice to the Admin Panel. However, the diff cannot evidence that a build+deploy was executed or that the deploy output included (or still lacked) the Publish URL/Open App link, and the notice text does not clearly state the “pause and retry later” plan requested.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Run a new build+deploy after the version bump and record whether Caffeine shows a Publish URL / “Open App” link (or capture the missing-URL outcome/error for follow-up).",
      "reason": "The diff shows BUILD_VERSION was bumped, but there is no verifiable evidence in the provided file changes that an actual build+deploy was executed, nor any recorded deploy output/outcome as required by the acceptance criteria.",

      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Admin Panel notice should explain that if Publish URL / “Open App” is missing after a successful deploy, it’s a platform issue and the team will pause and retry later.",
      "reason": "A notice was added, but its copy focuses on refreshing/switching tabs and states it’s a platform UI issue; it does not clearly communicate the requested “pause and retry later” plan.",

      "description": "Added a release notes template file with sections unrelated to this deploy-retry request (e.g., V40+ backend cleanup / HOTEL DUMMY purge content).",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest is scoped to a deploy retry/release bump and an Admin Panel notice, and explicitly says not to change backend logic; adding extensive release note templates referencing backend cleanup is not requested by the requirements.",
