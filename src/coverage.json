The purge must delete every room record belonging to the target hotel (including all fields such as room number/type/price/currency/pictures) and must also remove those room IDs from the hotel’s stored room list so the hotel ends up with **zero rooms**.",

The upgrade cleanup must locate the hotel record by name match \"HOTEL DUMMY\" and then perform the full room purge described in REQ-41, and persist a flag so the purge is not re-run on every upgrade.",
